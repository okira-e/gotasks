# GoTasks - A Kanban board in your terminal
Ever wanted an alternative to the todo.txt file in your project directory that isn't a full web app running in a browser that has hundreds of networking features that you don't want? This is what GoTasks is for!
It is a simple `gotasks` command that you run in the directory (or sub directory) of you project in your terminal and it immediately gives you a Kanban of all your tasks and progress.
